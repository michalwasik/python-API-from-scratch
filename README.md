Hi. This is my first HTTP server written from basics. It's simple project to test my servers/coding/databases/html knowledge.

Main site is a list of race tracks form which you can chose one to add yours lap time.

After checking by using http post methode if you had added data correctly all informations are being stored in JSON database. And after all these steps you can see other users laptimes implemented by http get method.
